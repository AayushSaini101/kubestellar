# Kubestellar multi-cluster workload deployment with kubectl

This test is an executable variant of the "multi-cluster workload deployment with kubectl" scenario in [the examples doc](../../../docs/content/v0.20/examples.md), testing the local copy of the repo rather than things built earlier, and has the same prerequisites.

## Running the test using a script

Starting from a local directory containing the git repo, do the following.

```
cd test/e2e/multi-cluster-deployment
./run-test.sh
```
