        description: SinglePlacementSlice is the interface between "scheduling" and
          syncing. For a given EdgePlacement object, the scheduler figures out which
          Locations match that EdgePlacement and selects the SyncTarget to use within
          that Location, then puts these results into some SinglePlacementSlice API
          objects. We use potentially multiple API objects so that no one of them
          has to get very big.
