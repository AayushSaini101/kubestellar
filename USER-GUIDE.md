This guide is intended to show how to quickly bring up a **KCP-Edge** environment with its dependencies from a binary release.

## 1. Install **KCP-Edge** pre-requisites

### a. `kubectl`

Detailed installation instructions for different operative systems are available [the kubectl installation instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

### b. `kcp`

Since `KCP-Edge` leverages [`kcp`](kcp.io) logical workspace virtualization capability, we have to install `kcp` v0.11.0 binaries first by following the detailed installation instructions available [on the kcp website](https://docs.kcp.io/kcp/main/#download-kcp) or by using the script below:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kcp-dev/edge-mc/main/hack/install-kcp-with-plugins.sh) --version v0.11.0 --folder $(pwd)/kcp --create-folder
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/kcp/bin"
```

Start **kcp** with the following command:

```bash
kcp start >& kcp_log.txt &
export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/.kcp/admin.kubeconfig"
```

It should be noted that, when **kcp** is running with the command above, it listens to all of the host's non-loopback addresses and picks one to put in the generated `admin.kubeconfig` file. While this works fine in most cases, such as when using a kind cluster locally (see later), sometimes it may be necessary to specify a public/external ip address that can be reached by remote clusters. For this purpose, the following command should be used:


```bash
kcp start --bind-address <ip_address> >& kcp_log.txt &
export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/.kcp/admin.kubeconfig"
```

In this case, the specified `<ip_address>` will appear in the generated `admin.kubeconfig` generated by the `kcp`.

After few seconds, check that `kcp` is running using the command:

```bash
kubectl version --short
```

which should yield something like:

```text
Client Version: v1.25.3
Kustomize Version: v4.5.7
Server Version: v1.24.3+kcp-v0.11.0
```

Additionally, one can check the available virtual workspaces using the command:

```bash
kubectl ws tree
```

which should yield something like:

```text
.
└── root
    └── compute
```

## 2. Install and run **KCP-Edge**

Download the kcp **KCP-Edge** binaries and scripts into a `kcp-edge` subfolder in your current working directory using the following command:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kcp-dev/edge-mc/main/hack/install-kcp-edge.sh) --version v0.1.0 --folder $(pwd)/kcp-edge --create-folder
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/kcp-edge/bin"
```

Start **KCP-Edge** with the following command:

```bash
kcp-edge start --user kit
```

Check that `KCP-Edge` controllers are running with the following command:

```bash
ps aux | grep -e mailbox-controller -e placement-translator -e scheduler
```

which should yield something like:

```text
user     1892  0.0  0.3 747644 29628 pts/1    Sl   10:51   0:00 mailbox-controller --inventory-context=root --mbws-context=base -v=2
user     1902  0.3  0.3 743652 27504 pts/1    Sl   10:51   0:02 scheduler -v 2 --root-user kcp-admin --root-cluster root --sysadm-context system:admin --sysadm-user shard-admin
user     1912  0.3  0.5 760428 41660 pts/1    Sl   10:51   0:02 placement-translator --allclusters-context system:admin -v=2
```

Check that the Edge Service Provider Workspace (`espw`) is created with the following command:

```bash
kubectl ws tree
```

which should yield:

```text
.
└── root
    ├── compute
    └── espw
```

## 3. Create a kcp-edge Inventory Management Workspace (IMW) and Workload Management Workspace (WMW)

**IMW** are used by **KCP-Edge** to store *sync targets* and *placement* objects.
Create an **IMW** named `imw-1` with the following command:

```bash
kubectl ws root
kubectl ws create "imw-1"
```

**WMW** are used by **KCP-Edge** to store *workloads* amd *edge placement* objects.
Create an **WMW** named `wmw-1` in a `my-org` workspace with the following command:

```shell
kubectl ws root
kubectl ws create "my-org"
kcp-edge --create_wmw wmw-1  # replaces: ensure-wmw.sh "wmw-1"
```


## 4. Example deployment of nginx workload into a kind local cluster

 
### a. Stand up a local florin kind cluster

To install kind in your environment follow the instructions [here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). To use kind, you will also need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```shell
kind create cluster --name florin
```  

### b. Create a sync target, placement and edge syncer for onboarding the created florin edge cluster

Create a syncTarget and location inventory objects to represent the edge cluster (`florin`):

```shell
kcp-edge --create_inv_item florin  env=prod    # replaces ensure-location.sh florin  env=prod
```

The following commands list the objects that were created:

```console
$ kubectl get locations,synctargets
NAME                                RESOURCE      AVAILABLE   INSTANCES   LABELS   AGE
location.scheduling.kcp.io/florin   synctargets   0           1                    57s

NAME                                AGE
synctarget.workload.kcp.io/florin   58s
```

Generate the edge syncer manifest:

```shell
kubectl ws root:espw
kcp-edge --syncer florin  # replaces: mailbox-prep.sh florin
```


which should yield something like:

```console
Current workspace is "root:espw:19igldm1mmolruzr-mb-6b0309f0-84f3-4926-9344-81df2f989f69" (type root:universal).

Creating service account "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44"
Creating cluster role "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44" to give service account "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44"

1. write and sync access to the synctarget "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44"
2. write access to apiresourceimports.

Creating or updating cluster role binding "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44" to bind service account "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44" to cluster role "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44".

Wrote physical cluster manifest to florin-syncer.yaml for namespace "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44". Use

  KUBECONFIG=<edge-cluster-config> kubectl apply -f "florin-syncer.yaml"

to apply it. Use

  KUBECONFIG=<edge-cluster-config> kubectl get deployment -n "kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44" kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44

to verify the syncer pod is running.
```

An edge syncer manifest yaml file is created in your current director: `florin-syncer.yaml`. The default for the output file is the name of the SyncTarget object with “-syncer.yaml” appended.

Now deploy the edge syncer to the `florin` edge cluster:

  
```shell
KUBECONFIG=$florin_kubeconfig kubectl apply -f florin-syncer.yaml
```

which should yield something like:

```console
namespace/kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44 created
serviceaccount/kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44 created
secret/kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44-token created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44 created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44 created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kcp-edge-dns-florin-5c4r0a44 created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kcp-edge-dns-florin-5c4r0a44 created
secret/kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44 created
deployment.apps/kcp-edge-syncer-florin-5c4r0a44 created
```

Check that the edge syncer pod is running:

```console
KUBECONFIG=$florin_kubeconfig kubectl get pods -A
```

which should yield something like:

```console
NAMESPACE                         NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

``` 

### c. Create the nginx workload and deploy it to the florin cluster

Create the `EdgePlacement` object for your workload. Its “where predicate” (the locationSelectors array) has one label selector that matches the Location object (`florin`) created earlier, thus directing the workload to `florin` edge cluster.

In the `wmw-1` workspace create the following `EdgePlacement` object: 
  
```console
kubectl ws root:my-org:wmw-1
```

```console
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: edge.kcp.io/v1alpha1
  kind: EdgePlacement
  metadata:
    name: edge-placement-c
  spec:
    locationSelectors:
    - matchLabels: {"env":"prod"}
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels: {"common":"si"}
    nonNamespacedObjects:
    - apiGroup: apis.kcp.io
      resources: [ "apibindings" ]
      resourceNames: [ "bind-kube" ]
    upsync:
    - apiGroup: "group1.test"
      resources: ["sprockets", "flanges"]
      namespaces: ["orbital"]
      names: ["george", "cosmo"]
    - apiGroup: "group2.test"
      resources: ["cogs"]
      names: ["william"]
  EOF
```

Deploy the nginx workload. Note the namespace label matches the label in the namespaceSelector for the EdgePlacement (`edge-placement-c`) object created above. 

```console
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: commonstuff
    labels: {common: "si"}
  ---
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: nginx-deployment
    namespace: commonstuff
    labels:
      app: nginx
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: nginx
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  EOF
  ```

Check that the deployment was created in the florin edge cluster:

```console
KUBECONFIG=$florin_kubeconfig kubectl -n commonstuff get deployment
```

which should yield something like:

```console
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           8m37s
```

Also, check that the pods are running in the florin edge cluster:

```console
KUBECONFIG=$florin_kubeconfig kubectl -n commonstuff get pods
```

which should yield something like:

```console
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b-2hkwt   1/1     Running   0          8m57s
nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b-9lxtc   1/1     Running   0          8m57s
nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b-k8pp7   1/1     Running   0          8m57s
```

## 5. Cleanup the environment

To uninstall kcp-edge run the following command:

```bash
kcp-edge stop
```

To uninstall kcp, kcp-edge and delete all the generated files (e.g., edge syncer manifests and logs files) run the following command:

```shell
kcp-edge cleanup
```
