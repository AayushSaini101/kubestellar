## Contributing Code
### Issues
Prioritization for pull requests is given to those that address and resolve existing GitHub issues. Utilize the available issue labels to identify meaningful and relevant issues to work on.

If you believe that there is a need for a fix and no existing issue covers it, feel free to create a new one.

As a new contributor, we encourage you to start with issues labeled as good first issues.

Your assistance in improving documentation is highly valued, regardless of your level of experience with the project.

To claim an issue that you are interested in, kindly leave a comment on the issue and request the maintainers to assign it to you.

### Committing
We encourage all contributors to adopt best practices in git commit management to facilitate efficient reviews and retrospective analysis. Your git commits should provide ample context for reviewers and future codebase readers.

A recommended format for final commit messages is as follows:

```
{Type}: {Short Title}: {Problem this commit is solving and any important contextual information}
```
