<h3 class="text-center">KCP-Edge is a subproject of kcp focusing on concerns arising from edge multicluster use cases:</h3>
{{% blocks/section %}}
- Hierarchy, infrastructure & platform, roles & responsibilities, integration architecture, security issues
- Runtime in[ter]dependence: An edge location may need to operate independently of the center and other edge locations
- Non-namespaced objects: need general support
- Cardinality of destinations: A source object may propagate to many thousands of destinations.

<h1 class="text-center">Goals</h1>
{{% blocks/section %}}
- collaboratively design a component set similar to those found in the current kcp TMC implementation (dedicated Workspace type, scheduler, syncer-like mechanism, edge placement object definition, status collection strategy, and etc.)
- Specify a multi-phased proof-of-concept inclusive of component architecture, interfaces, and example workloads
- Validate phases of proof-of-concept with kcp, Kube SIG-Multicluster, and CNCF community members interested in Edge

<h1 class="text-center">Areas of Exploration</h1>
{{% blocks/section %}}
- Desired placement expression: Need a way for one center object to express large number of desired copies
- Scheduling/syncing interface: Need something that scales to large number of destinations
- Rollout control: Client needs programmatic control of rollout, possibly including domain-specific logic
- Customization: Need a way for one pattern in the center to express how to customize for all the desired destinations
- Status from many destinations: Center clients may need a way to access status from individual edge copies
- Status summarization: Client needs a way to say how statuses from edge copies are processed/reduced along the way from edge to center
