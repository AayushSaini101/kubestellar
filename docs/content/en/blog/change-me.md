     Jun Duan (1:30) gives a demo on ArgoCD and the bottlenecks that occur as users approach 10,000 managed applications.  We relate this information back to how we might overcome these challenges using KCP-Edge in the future working together with benchmarking efforts in the ArgoCD community.  Kevin Roche (19:40) gives a demo on using one of OpenAI's GPT models to adjust deployment parameters inside a Kubernetes deployment manifest.  This work demonstrates why it is important to implement some level of automation into the placement and workload definition process when trying to configure large numbers of heterogenous edge locations.  The KCP-Edge community is actively exploring what it will take to incorporate any cloud-native project/product to automate and influence the placement and workload definitions using consistent interfaces and a modular integration strategy.
