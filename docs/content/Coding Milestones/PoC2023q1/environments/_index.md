There will be 2 environments designed, created, and maintained for KCP-Edge:</br></br>
- A cloud environment (cloud-env) which will be used to deploy, scale, and measure metrics associated with small, medium, and large-scale KCP-Edge experiments,</br></br>
- A development environment (dev-env) which will be used to deploy a small local KCP-Edge installation that is sized for daily use and experimentation on a laptop.</br>
